////// Priority

////// Fix/improve
* on search.php, make a search with filter on owner
* when you follow a link and you're not logged in, you want to be redirected to the target page after login
* editable list of status
* add tag on templates
* have a visibility status for experiments : hidden (only you), team, public (don't need account to read it)

////// New Features
* use password_hash
* read only status for past members
* have real auth with LDAP etc... like here : http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Authentication
