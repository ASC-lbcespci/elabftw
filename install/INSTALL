Thank you for choosing eLabFTW as a lab manager.

Here is what you need in order to install it :

- a server running GNU/Linux (although a Mac OS X or Windows server might work too, but I wouldn't recommand it)
- with PHP5, MySQL5 (other relational database might work, as it uses PDO), Apache (other http servers might work)
- basic knowledge of server administration, command line work
- root access to the server ^^

Have everything ?
Now, let's begin :


INSTALL
*********************

Connect to your server via SSH and fireup tmux (or screen).
If you don't know what is SSH, maybe it's not a good idea to try and install eLabFTW.

As root, cd to your public directory (/var/www generally) and enter these commands :

PHP part
*********

(If you are behind a proxy :
# export http_proxy=proxy-adress.company.org:3128
)
Get latest version
# wget http://www.elabftw.net/pub/latest-stable.tar.gz
Extract it in the public folder
# tar xzf latest.tar.gz
Now you have all the php files, we just need to add a library so the mails can be sent
# pear channel-discover pear.swiftmailer.org
# pear install swift/swift

SQL part
***********

Connect :
Command to connect with the user `root` and the password `secr3t`
# mysql -uroot -psecr3t

Create a database (at the mysql prompt)
mysql> CREATE DATABASE `elabftw` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

Exit with Ctrl-d, and enter this if you are in the same directory as the sql file:
# mysql -uroot -psecr3t elabftw < elabftw.sql

Now register an account, and set it admin by modifying the `is_admin` column in `users` table :
mysql> UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE userid = 1

Now edit the `admin/config-example.ini` file and rename it to `config.ini`.

You should be good to go. Email me in case of troubles : nicolas.carpi@gmail.com

In the future, I hope to automate all this install part ^^
