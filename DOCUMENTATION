This file is for developpers who want to help with the code, and also for me, as a reminder of stuff I did...

eLabFTW uses :
* PDO in order to deal with the MySQL database
* jQuery + jQuery UI + various plugins for the eye-candy
* php version > 5
* mysql version > 5

Use of git : https://gitorious.org/elabftw
I know all the cool kids are on Github, but Github source code isn't available, unlike gitorious !
Developped with vim, and 4 spaces indent.

* Use of fpdf http://www.fpdf.org for the pdf creation
* Use of Swiftmailer http://swiftmailer.org for sending email with SMTP
