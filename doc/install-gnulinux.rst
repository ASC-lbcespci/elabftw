Introduction
------------

Please refer to your distribution's documentation to install :

* a webserver (like nginx, Apache, lighttpd or cherokee)
* php version > 5.4 with the following extensions : gettext, gd, openssl, hash, curl
* mysql version > 5.5
* git

If you don't know how to do that, have a look at `installing eLabFTW on a cheap server (drop) <https://github.com/elabftw/drop-elabftw#how-to-use>`_.

I wouldn't recommend HHVM because Gettext support is not here yet (see `this issue <https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/1228>`_).

Getting the files
-----------------

The first part is to get the files composing `eLabFTW` on your server.


Option 1 : Using git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect to your server with SSH::

    $ ssh user@12.34.56.78

`cd` to the public directory where you want `eLabFTW` to be installed (can be /var/www, ~/public\_html, or any folder you'd like, as long as the webserver is configured properly, in doubt use /var/www)

::

    $ cd /var/www
    # make the directory writable by your user (if it's not already the case)
    $ sudo chown `whoami`:`whoami` .

Note the `.` at the end that means `current folder`.

Get latest stable version via git::

    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw.git

(this will create a folder `elabftw`)
The `--depth 1` option is to avoid downloading the whole history.

If you cannot connect, try exporting your proxy settings in your shell like so::

    $ export https_proxy="proxy.example.com:3128"

If you still cannot connect, tell git your proxy::

    $ git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080


Option 2 :Â Download archive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest release from `this page <https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/latest>`_ as a zip archive or a tarball.

Copy it to your server with FTP or SCP, or directly wget it from the server.

SQL part
--------

The second part is putting the database in place.

Option 1 : Command line way
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    # first we connect to mysql
    $ mysql -u root -p
    # we create the database (note the ; at the end !)
    mysql> create database elabftw;
    # we create the user that will connect to the database.
    mysql> grant usage on *.* to elabftw@localhost identified by 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
    # we give all rights to this user on this database
    mysql> grant all privileges on elabftw.* to elabftw@localhost;
    mysql> exit

You will be asked for the password you put after `identified by` three lines above.


Option 2 : Graphical way with phpmyadmin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to install the package `phpmyadmin` if it's not already done.

**Note**: it is not recommended to have phpmyadmin installed on a production server (for security reasons).

::

    $ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

Now you will connect to the phpmyadmin panel from your browser on your computer. Type the IP address of the server followed by /phpmyadmin.

Example : https://12.34.56.78/phpmyadmin

Login with the root user on PhpMyAdmin panel (use the password you setup for mysql root user).

Create a user `elabftw` with all rights on the database `elabftw`

Now click the `Users` tab and click ![add user](http://i.imgur.com/SJmdg0Z.png).

Do like this :

Final step
----------

Finally, point your browser to the install folder (install/) and read onscreen instructions.

For example : https://12.34.56.78/elabftw/install
