Thank you for choosing eLabFTW as a lab manager.

Here is what you need in order to install it :

- a server running GNU/Linux (although a Mac OS X or Windows server might work too, but I wouldn't recommand it)
- with PHP5, MySQL5 (other relational database might work, as it uses PDO), Apache (other http servers might work)
- basic knowledge of server administration, command line work
- root access to the server ^^

Have everything ?
Now, let's begin :


INSTALL
*********************

Connect to your server via SSH and fireup tmux (or screen).
If you don't know what is SSH, maybe it's not a good idea to try and install eLabFTW.

As root, cd to your public directory (/var/www generally) and enter these commands :

PHP part
*********

(If you are behind a proxy :
# export http_proxy=proxy-adress.company.org:3128
)
Get latest version
# wget http://www.elabftw.net/downloads/latest.zip
Extract it in the public folder
# unzip latest.zip
Now you have all the php files, we just need to add a library so the mails can be sent
# pear channel-discover pear.swiftmailer.org
# pear install swift/swift

SQL part
***********

# mysql -uroot -ppassword < create_tables.sql
