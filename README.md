# Description

**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. It also features a database where you can store any kind of objects (think antibodies, plasmids, cell lines, boxes, _etc_â€¦)
It is accessed _via_ the browser by the users. Several research teams can be hosted on the same install, so **eLabFTW** can be installed at the institute level and host everyone at the same place (this is what is done at [Institut Curie](http://www.curie.fr) and in several other research centers across the globe.

- Tired of that shared excel file for your antibodies or plasmids ?

- Want to be able to search in your past experiments as easily as you'd do it on google ?

- Want an electronic lab notebook that lets you timestamp legally your experiments ?

Then you are at the right place !

**eLabFTW** is designed to be installed on a server, and people from the team would just log into it from their browser.
Don't have a server ? That's okay, you can use an old computer with 1 Go of RAM and an old CPU, it's more than enough. Just install a recent GNU/Linux distribution on it and plug it to the intranet.
