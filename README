eLaFTW (electronic lab for the world)
is a free and open-source experiments and database manager.
You can store your experiments (like an lab notebook, but better).
You can have a database of whatever objects (antibodies, siRNA, horses, plasmids, etcâ€¦).
You can search efficiently, export your results in a .zip archive or in a spreadsheet.
It was made by researchers, for researchers, with usability in mind.

Just try it, you'll love it :)
