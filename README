eLaFTW (electronic lab for the world)
is a free and open-source experiments and database manager.
You can store your experiments (like an experiment notebook, but better).
You can have a database of whatever objects (antibodies, siRNA, horses, whateverâ€¦).

You can install it on a server for a team, or on your own computer and choose to share or not your database.

The install part is yet to come.
Rest works fine.

Paper is dead. ENJOY !
