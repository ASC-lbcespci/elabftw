<h2>RULES</h2>
<p>
Pick a recent paper (no more than 6 months old) somewhat close to your project or lab area of interest (for instance cell polarity,
microfluidics or a development paper in C. elegans is OK, evolution of gold fish maybe not).  You should try to think what would be
interesting for the group and what you want to share with the group -like some important advance relevant to your own project that
would be good for the group.<br />

Each presentation will be 8 minutes, with 3 minutes for questions, all of it controlled thoroughly with a timer!!<br />

<br />
It should include:<br />

- Title, main authors, Location, Journal<br />


- Background:  focus on the primary problem addressed.<br />

What was not known before?  What is important about this paper? What is the question/or the new technique? Why did you pick it?<br />

- Results:  focus on a couple of the most important findings/approaches<br />
You won't have time to go through all the results.<br />
To save time it is advised to prepare a ppt with 1-2 figures or movie but you may also draw on the board.<br />

- Discussion:  your evaluation; was this a good, believable, significant paper?  any limitations? brought up new ideas for your
project?
